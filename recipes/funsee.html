    <p>This recipe is from <a href="https://eatchofood.com/blog/2021/1/26/fun-see">Eat Cho Food</a>.</p>
    <p>One of my favorite and most comforting dishes that my mom would cook is fun see (sometimes called hly fun), or stir-fried bean thread noodles. This was often paired with steamed eggs, fish, rice, and sometimes Chinese sausage with the meal. I've never seen a recipe that cooks it with ground pork, so this looks really yummy!</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>4 oz bean thread noodles</li>
        <li>1/4 cup dried small shrimp</li>
        <li>2 tbsp olive oil</li>
        <li>4 cloves of garlic, minced</li>
        <li>1/2 lb ground pork</li>
        <li>2 tbsp oyster sauce</li>
        <li>1/2 tsp white pepper</li>
        <li>1/2 tsp coarse salt</li>
        <li>1/2 tsp sugar</li>
        <li>1 1/2 tsp sesame oil</li>
        <li>4 stalks green onions, chopped</li>
        <li>1 tbsp sesame seeds</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Soak the noodles in hot water until tender, 4 to 6 minutes. Drain the water and set noodles aside. Avoid over-soaking, which will cause the noodles to break in the stir-fry.</li>
        <li>Soak the dried shrimp in hot water until tender, 10 to 15 minutes. Drain the water and set the shrimp aside. If you have larger dried shrimp, give them a rough chop into smaller pieces.</li>
        <li>Heat oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Add the garlic, stir, and continue to cook until fragrant and just starting to brown slightly, 1 to 2 minutes. Add the ground pork, breaking up with the edge of a spatula or wooden spoon. Continue to cook, stirring occasional, until almost fully cooked and browned, 6 to 7 minutes. </li>
        <li>Add the shrimp and season with oyster sauce, white pepper, salt, sugar, and sesame oil and stir to incorporate. Add the noodles, green onions, and sesame seeds. Toss to fully coat the noodles. Taste and adjust seasonings to your liking before serving.</li>
    </ol>
